  "review": "Dinner today was decent, but it did not exceed expectations. The main dish was okay but lacked strong flavors. The side dish, while fine, didn‚Äôt offer much in terms of excitement or variety. It was filling, but not particularly memorable. A little more attention to flavor balance and creativity would make a big difference.",
